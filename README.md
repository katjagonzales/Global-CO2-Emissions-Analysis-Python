# Global-CO2-Emissions-Analysis-Python
Analysis of global CO2 emissions data conducted in Python using machine learning techniques as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics program.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to source a data set of my own choice and define key questions to perform a data analysis utilizing Python. 

I chose a dataset that includes measurements on CO2 emissions (annual, per capita, cumulative and consumption-based), other greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant metrics for the years 1750 â€“ 2021.

My goal was to look into the distribution of CO2 emissions and key factors, focusing on:
-  Exploring relationships between CO2 emissions and other variables.
-  Identifying countries that produce the highest CO2 emissions.
- Investigating different sources of energy and respective levels of emissions.

## Data
The dataset is publicly disclosed open data collected by
